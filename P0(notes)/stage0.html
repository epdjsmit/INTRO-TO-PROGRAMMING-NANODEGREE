                <p>
                    The web is a bunch of computers that communicate with each other. When a person goes to a web page like www.google.com, their computer sends a HTTP Request to a server. The server finds the appropriate HTML document and sends it back to the user's computer where a web browser interprets the page and displays it on the user's screen.

                <h3><span class="heading">HTML</span></h3>
                <p>
                    HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. HTML documents form the majority of the content on the web. HTML documents contain text content which describes "what you see" and markup which describes "how it looks". <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer/#!/c-ud000/l-4185478836/m-48724340">This video</a> gives a good overview.

                <p>
                    <b>HTML</b> documents are made of HTML elements. When writing HTML, we tell browsers the type of each element by using HTML tags. <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer/#!/c-ud000/l-4185478836/m-48723444">This video</a> explains the distinction well.

                <h3><span class="heading">Why Compuers are Stupid</span></h3>
                <p>
                    Computers are stupid because they interpret instructions literally. This makes them very unforgiving since a small mistake by a programmer can cause huge problems in a program.

                <h3><span class="heading">Inline vs Block Elements</span></h3>
                <p>
                    HTML elements are either inline or block. Block elements form an "invisible box" around the content inside of them.

                <h3><span class="heading">Developer Tools (in the Browser)</span></h3>
                <p>
                    HTML elements are either inline or block. Block elements form an <em>"invisible box"</em> around the content inside of them.

                <h3><span class="heading">The "tree-like structure" of HTML</span></h3>
                <p>
                    The <em>"tree-like structure"</em> comes from the fact that HTML elements can have other elements inside of them. You can draw this relationship like a family tree. My mother had multiple children. So did her mother, and so on...
                    In a browser, this structure shows up as a series of nested boxes. There are boxes inside of boxes inside of boxes, and so on...

                <h3><span class="heading">The relationship between indented HTML and boxes</span></h3>
                <p>
                    When you read an HTML document as text, you see a wave of changing indentations going up and down the left side of the document. The more indented an element is, the more deeply nested it's corresponding "box" is.

                <h3><span class="heading">Text Editors (for programming)</span></h3>
                <p>
                    When writing code, programmers use special text editors (like Sublime Text for example). These editors make the programmer's life easier. For example, some text editors will automatically generate a closing HTML tag when you write an opening tag.
